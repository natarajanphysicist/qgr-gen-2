# Documentation Roadmap

This folder will contain API documentation, tutorials, and example notebooks for the LQG simulation toolkit.

## Planned Structure
- API Reference (autogenerated from docstrings)
- User Guide (installation, usage, extending the toolkit)
- Example Notebooks (Jupyter)
- Research References

## Quick Links
- [Plugin System](plugins.md)
- [Quantum Simulation](quantum_sim.md)
- [Efficient Spinfoam Summation](spinfoam_summation.md)
- [3D/Animated Visualization](plot3d.md)
- [Interactive Jupyter Demo](../lqg_simulation/examples/lqg_interactive_demo.ipynb)

## Getting Started
- See the main [README.md](../README.md) for installation and core usage.
- Try the interactive Jupyter notebook for a hands-on workflow.
