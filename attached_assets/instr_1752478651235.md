Okay, you're asking for the "full final project" based on the original high-level goals. That's a significant leap from where we are, as the initial plan was very ambitious, covering many advanced research topics in LQG!

So far, we've built a foundational toolkit:

    Core spin network data structures.
    Calculation of 3j, 6j, and 9j Wigner symbols.
    A very basic placeholder for vertex amplitudes.
    Simple 2D visualization of spin networks.

To move towards a "full final project" as envisioned in your first message (quantum gravity simulation, loop quantum gravity, spin networks, transition amplitudes, curved spacetime, Winner 3j,6j,9j,12j,15j symbols, emergence of spacetime, initial stages of the universe, singularity resolution, quantum computing simulations, plots producing, an advanced simulation tool), we would need to tackle many more complex steps. Each of these could be a substantial project in itself.

Given our current state, here's what a realistic multi-step plan towards a more advanced (though not entirely "full final") version might look like. This will still take many steps:

Phase 1: Enhancing Amplitudes and Dynamics (Focusing on Spinfoam Components)

    Implement 15j Symbols (or key components): Since 15j symbols (specifically the {10j} part for SU(2)) are central to 4D spinfoam models like EPRL-FK, this is a logical next mathematical tool. This might involve combining 6j or 9j symbols if a direct wigner_15j isn't available or suitable in Sympy.
    Define a Concrete Spinfoam Vertex Amplitude: Implement a simplified but recognized vertex amplitude. For example:
        The Ooguri model vertex (3D TQFT), which is directly related to a {6j} symbol for a tetrahedron (could be a good way to make the current placeholder more concrete).
        Or, the SU(2) part of an EPRL-FK like vertex for a 4-simplex. This would use the {10j}/{15j} symbols.
    Define Edge Amplitudes (Face Amplitudes in Spinfoam): Implement the weighting factors for the edges (faces in the dual 2-complex), which usually depend on the area (spin j) and the Immirzi parameter.
    Develop Spinfoam Summation (Simplified): Create a structure to represent a simple 2-complex (e.g., one or two glued 4-simplices, or a few glued tetrahedra for 3D). Implement a function to calculate the total amplitude by summing over products of vertex, edge, and face amplitudes. This sum might initially be over a fixed, small configuration without summing over intermediate spins if that's too complex.

Phase 2: Incorporating Geometry and Basic Evolution 5. Geometric Observables (Placeholder): Define functions to calculate basic geometric observables from a spin network, like total volume or area based on some quantization scheme (e.g., V ~ sum_v sqrt(V_v), A ~ sum_l sqrt(j_l(j_l+1))). 6. Simple Dynamic Moves: Implement a few local evolution moves on the spin network (e.g., changing a spin, adding/removing a node/link, or a Pachner-like move on the dual complex). 7. Update Observables after Moves: Show how observables change after these moves.

Phase 3: Expanding Scope (Towards more advanced goals) 8. (Conceptual) Curved Spacetime Representation: Discuss or implement a very basic way to think about how the discrete structure could approximate curved spacetime (e.g., by assigning deficit angles or some other curvature measure to elements of the complex). 9. (Conceptual) Singularity Resolution Idea: Show, with a highly simplified model (perhaps just evolving the total volume observable), how LQG's discrete nature or a bounce could be represented, avoiding a zero-volume singularity. 10. Enhanced Plotting: More sophisticated visualizations, perhaps 3D, or plotting observables over simulation "time" (steps of moves).

Quantum Computing and Initial Universe stages would be significantly further research-level extensions.

This is still a very high-level roadmap. Each point would need its own detailed plan.

Before I create a new detailed plan for the very next step, which of these broader areas interests you most to begin with for this next phase? For example, should we prioritize getting the 15j symbols and a concrete spinfoam vertex implemented first? Or perhaps focus on simple dynamic moves and observable changes?
